<h1> Matlab Basics </h1>
</div>

MATLAB is an abbreviation for "matrix laboratory." While other programming languages mostly work with numbers one at a time, MATLAB¬Æ is designed to operate primarily on whole matrices and arrays.

All MATLAB variables are multidimensional arrays, no matter what type of data. A matrix is a two-dimensional array often used for linear algebra.

## __*Matrix and Arrays*__

 * To create an array with four elements in a single row, separate the elements with either a comma (,) or a space.

```matlab
a = [1 2 3 4]
```
This type of array is a row vector.

 * To create a matrix that has multiple rows, separate the rows with semicolons.

```matlab
a = [1 3 5; 2 4 6; 7 8 10]
```

 * Another way to create a matrix is to use a function, such as ones, zeros, or rand. For example, create a 5-by-1 column vector of zeros.

```matlab
z = zeros(5,1)
```

### *Operations on arrays or matrices*

- Addition and Subtraction:

```matlab
a = [10 6 8 9];
b = [11 2 14 7];
result = a+b
ans = a-b
```
Note that addition and subtraction are done element by element.

 - Multiplication:

```matlab
a = [1 2 3; 3 4 5; 6 7 8];
b = [12 45 9; 23 9 15; 9 10 38];
a*b
```

Note that for 2 matrices to be multiplied the number of rows of columns of first matrix should be equal to the number of rows of the second matrix.

 - Transpose:

```matlab
a'
```

 - Inverse of the matrix:

```matlab
inv(a)
```

 - Power and scalar multiplication:

```matlab
a.^3   %power element by element 
a.*4   %scalar multiplication
```

## Power of a signal :

Power is defined as the amount of energy consumed per unit time. This quantity is useful if the energy of the signal goes to infinity or the signal is ‚Äúnot-squarely-summable‚Äù.

```matlab
function [p] = sigpower(n)
    b = n.*n;
    p = sum(b)/length(b);
end
```

## Energy of a signal :

A signal is said to be an energy signal if and only if its total energy E is finite, i.e., 0 < ùê∏ < ‚àû. For an energy signal, the average power P = 0. The nonperiodic signals are the examples of energy signals.

```matlab
function [s] = energy(n)
    n = n.*n;
    s = sum(n);
end
```


## Types of time signals

- Continuous time signals x(t): defined at every point in time
- Discrete time signals x[n]: defined only at a discrete set of values of time (integer)

## Properties of systems:

### Periodicity- 

the signal‚Äôs behavior/graph repeats after every T. Therefore,
   $$x(t)=x(t+nT)\ or\ x(t)=x(t-nT)$$  
here T is the fundamental period
So we can say signal remains unchanged when shifted by multiples of T.

### Even and Odd- 
an even signal is symmetric about the Y-axis.
x(t)=x(-t) even
x(t)=-x(-t) odd
A signal can be broken into it‚Äôs even and odd parts to make certain conversions easy.

### Linearity-

*(i) Additivity/Superposition-*
if x1(t) -> y1(t)
and x2(t) -> y2(t)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91787553/209510689-daf0b0dd-46be-42eb-bc52-f196b25c7594.png)

*(ii) Property of scaling-*
if x1(t) -> y1(t)
then

If both are satisfied, the system is linear.

### Time invariant- 
Any delay provided in the input must be reflected in the output for a time invariant system.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91787553/209510818-87e90c5d-1a0d-487e-ab41-ea2842b323e1.png)

here x2(t) is a delayed input.
We check if putting a delayed input through the system is the same as a delay in the output signal.

### LTI systems- 
A linear time invariant system. A system that is linear and time-invariant.

### BIBO stability- 
The bounded input bounded output stability.
We say a system is BIBO stable if-

### Causality- 
Causal signals are signals that are zero for all negative time.
If any value of the output signal depends on a future value of the input signal then the signal is non-causal.

### Memoryless system-
A causal system is memoryless if for any time t, the value of the output at time t depends only on the value of the input at time t.

Suppose that y(t)=kx(t)where k is a fixed real number. At any time t1

y (t1)=k x(t1)
And thus y (t1) depends only on the values of the input at time t1 Hence the system is memoryless.

### System Invertibility-
Invertibility in the system comes from a basic mathematical phenomenon called ‚Äúinverse‚Äù. If input signal can be retrieved from output signal then we say that particular system is invertible.

## Convolution- 
A convolution is an integral that expresses the amount of overlap of one function g as it is shifted over another function f. It therefore "blends" one function with another.

## Fourier Transform:
The Fourier Transform is a tool that breaks a waveform (a function or signal) into an alternate representation, characterized by the sine and cosine functions of varying frequencies. The Fourier Transform shows that any waveform can be re-written as the sum of sinusoidals.

All waveforms, no matter what you scribble or observe in the universe, are actually just the sum of simple sinusoids of different frequencies.
While this seems made up, it is true for all waveforms. This goes for TV signals, cell phone signals, the sound waves that travel when you speak. In general, waveforms are not made up of a discrete number of frequencies, but rather a continuous range of frequencies.

The Fourier Transform is the mathematical tool that shows us how to deconstruct the waveform into its sinusoidal components. This has a multitude of applications, aides in the understanding of the universe, and just makes life much easier for the practicing engineer or scientist.

### Fourier Series

The Fourier Series breaks down a periodic function into the sum of sinusoidal functions. It is the Fourier Transform for periodic functions. To start the analysis of Fourier Series, let's define periodic functions.
A function is periodic, with fundamental period T, if the following is true for all t:

f(t+T)=f(t)                      [Equation 1]

In plain English, this means that the a function of time with period T will have the same value in T seconds as it does now, no matter when you observe the function. Note that a periodic function with fundamental period T is also periodic with period 2*T. So the fundamental period is the value of T (greater than zero) that is the smallest possible T for which equation [1] is always true.

The Fourier Series showed us how to rewrite any periodic function into a sum of sinusoids. The Fourier Transform is the extension of this idea to non-periodic functions.

While the the Fourier Transform is a beautiful mathematical tool, its widespread popularity is due to its practical application in virtually every field of science and engineering. It's hard to understand why the Fourier Transform is so important. But I can assure you it enables the solution to difficult problems be made simpler (and also makes previously unsolved problems solvable). In addition, the Fourier Transform gives us a new method of viewing the world, which is fantastic for giving a more intuitive feel for our universe.
